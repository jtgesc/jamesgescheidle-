      <h2>Designing my personal portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        Creating my personal portfolio website has been one of the most valuable projects  
I have completed so far.The intended goal of this assignment was to end up building a fully functional, responsive,  
and visually appealing personal website with and by using a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jekyll, and GitHub  
Pages. This project did challenge me to think like both a designer and a developer, pushing me to plan  
carefully, structure all of the content thoughtfully, and produce a polished online website that overall just reflects me. 
Before i even wrote a single line of code, I researched existing portfolio designs to identify all the features, layouts, 
and color schemes that matched the look I wanted to create. I looked at color scheme layout  
options using Figma, which helped me map out the sites structure and improve my understanding of the  
relationship between design and implementation. This early planning stage taught me just exactly how crucial visual 
organization is before the development begins.From a technical standpoint,  this project provided a good hands-on  
experience with several of the important web development tools. Using HTML allowed me to build the structure of  
each page, while CSS gave me the ability to style and customize the visual part in all of the presentation. I incorporated  
Bootstrap, which greatly simplified the overall process of making the website responsive across laptops, tablets,  
and mobile devices. I also experimented with Jekyll, including Markdown-based pages and typical Jekyll  
structures used in many GitHub Pages sites. Hosting the entire project through GitHub Pages taught me how  
to manage repositories, push commits, and deploy a live website that updates automatically. 
One of the most meaningful lessons from this project was learning how to think through under-specified  
requirements—just  like in real-world development. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, I  had to  
interpret the guidelines, make design choices independently, and solve problems creatively. I encountered  
challenges such as maintaining a  clean responsive layout, ensuring my HTML passed W3C validation, and  
configuring the contact form using Web3Forms. Each  obstacle forced me  to keep going, research solutions,  
and improve my understanding of web standards and best practices.Throughout the process , I gained stronger  
skills in layout design, mobile responsiveness, content organization, and version control. I also ended up learning the  
importance of clarity, consistency, as well as accessibility in web design. Most importantly, this  project ended up showing me  
how to create a real, public-facing website that I can continue to update as I grow academically and  
professionally.In the end, my  portfolio website serves not only as a showcase of my work but also as a  
reflection of the skills and knowledge I have  developed. It stands as a foundation for my online presence 
and a  project I can  confidently share with employers, classmates, and anyone interested in seeing what I  
can create.
