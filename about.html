          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I am a finance major at St. Lawrence University, and before coming to SLU
             I graduated from Highland High School which is also located in New York. I have played football for as long as I can remember, 
             and the sport ended up shaping a huge part of who I am. Today, I am proud to continue that passion as a D3 
             football player at St. Lawrence. Off the field, I am grounded by my family, which is including both of my parents, my sister and our two dogs. 
             They all have always supported me in everything I do. Whether it is athletics, academics, or even just personal growth, 
             I am driven by commitment, teamwork, and the mindset of always pushing to be better than I was yesterday.

          <h4>Education</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
                I attended Highland High School in New York, where I built a strong academic 
                foundation and developed the discipline that has ended up carrying into my college career today. 
                I am currently a student at St. Lawrence University, pursuing a major in Finance as part 
                of the Class of 2028. My coursework has strengthened my analytical and quantitative skills that i will need later in life, 
                while also allowing me to explore all of the real-world applications in business and financial markets. 
                Through both academics and athletics, I am constantly working to grow as a student, teammate, 
                and future professional in whatever comes next.
            </li>
          </ul>
            <!--now i will write about my work experience and all that good stuff-->
          <h4>Experience</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
                I have built a strong and diverse work background through several hands-on and service-oriented roles. 
                I have worked for two landscaping companies, those being Angelone and Sons and Bakers and Sons, here is 
                where I handled a variety of manual labor tasks such as mulching, weed wacking, and maintaining 
                outdoor properties. These jobs taught me the value of hard work, consistency, and reliability. I also 
                currently work as a caterer for Sugar and Spice, gaining experience in customer service, teamwork, and 
                fast-paced event environments. In addition, I completed a shadowing experience at Fidelity with Jim Dunn, a 
                financial consultant, which gave me meaningful exposure to the finance industry and reinforced my interest in 
                pursuing a career in that field.
